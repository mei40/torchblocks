# TorchBlocks

TorchBlocks is a desktop GUI app written in TypeScript and Python that simplifies the construction, training and testing of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) models. 

TorchBlocks aims to reduce the complexity of programming with ML frameworks and seeks to get beginner computer science enthusiasts to work directly with tensors. 

This project was created for credit as a part of Purdue University’s ECE49595O. 

## Supported Operating Systems

TorchBlocks is primarily tested for Linux machines. 

Issues may arise more frequently on other operating systems. 

## Installation

The most up-to-date installation package will be under [Releases](https://github.com/mei40/torchblocks/releases).

Retrieve the installer, and follow the instructions. Run the generated executable to initialize the program. 

## Prerequisites

TorchBlocks requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9 or newer to be installed under the “python3” prefix.

Any necessary subsequent modules will be added to this Python installation. 

Using Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) also requires a Google Account, and prolonged use of Colab may require the purchase of a Colab Pro subscription or additional compute units.
